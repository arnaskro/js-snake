# js-snake
A responsive snake game made with JS, HTML and Bulma CSS framework

DEMO: https://arnaskro.github.io/js-snake/

## Introduction
This goal of this project was to make yet another JS based snake game and have a quick try out of my JavaScript skills.
The role of "Bulma CSS framework" in this project is to give a nice heading :)

## Conclusion
It is not perfect. It is not lightweight. It is not optimized. Instructions are not clear. 
But at least I had fun making this and did not use any npm or whatever for a simple project!
